# OpenMSM
http://www.openoandm.org/ws-isbm/1.0/ws-isbm.html

A RESTful based implementation of the services defined within the OpenOandM ws-ISBM WSDLs. 

This is a .NET Core 2.2 application. To run this, install Visual Studio 2017 (any edition).
Ensure that Visual Studio 2017 has "ASP.NET and web development", "Node.js development", and ".NET Core cross-platform development" features installed.

Prerequisites:
1) Nodejs
2) .NET Core 2.2 SDK 

Running the code:
1) For the FIRST time that you run Visual Studio to start an instance of the application, be sure to "Run as Administrator". On startup for the first time, the application creates a machine environment variable that it must leverage and this requires elevated privileges. 
2) Start an instance of the OpenMSM.Web project.
